	description "The Pai Lek 36 appears to have been built around a single concept: Utilise a fast, easily-constructable platform to provide a large amount of long-ranged fire support as cheaply as possible. Armed with a single Korath Detainer, these ships can be deployed in great numbers to cripple even the fastest ship's engines, allowing other ships in a Sestor fleet to rip apart the pinned target with shorter-ranged weapons."
	description "Despite being built for long-ranged combat, the Pai Lek 31 still sports a rather robust hull, suggesting that earlier models may have been intended to fight closer to the fray, where the ship might be in danger."
