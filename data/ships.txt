	description "The Pai Lek 36 appears to have been built around a single concept: Utilise a fast, easily-constructable platform to provide a large amount of long-ranged fire support as cheaply as possible. Armed with a single Korath Detainer, these ships can be deployed in great numbers to cripple even the fastest ship's engines, allowing other ships in a Sestor fleet to rip apart the pinned target with shorter-ranged weapons."
	description "Despite being built for long-ranged combat, the Pai Lek 31 still sports a rather robust hull, suggesting that earlier models may have been intended to fight closer to the fray, where the ship might be in danger."

	description `Built on the original Kar Ik Vot platform, the Kar Te Pet is a sight to behold.

	description "A carrier this big is impractical to most flesh being minds, but for the Sestor, it's simply the next evolution in their tactics: A carrier that carries carriers, each able to desperse a large crowd of disposable microdrones. A full complement can support a fearsome swarm, while the carrier itself is among the most powerful warships fielded by the Sestor."
